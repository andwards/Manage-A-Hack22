# Manage-A-Hack22 Competition

The Manage-A-Hack competition was organized by ECU's Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) club to foster collaboration between computer science and business students. The objective was to create and present a startup MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within a limited timeframe of 4 hours. Each group had to develop a prototype and a business plan centered around a startup idea that addressed a specific gap in eastern North Carolina.

## Alertify: Transportation Safety Service

Alertify is the name of our startup idea that focuses on transportation safety for college students. Our goal was to create a platform where students could connect with nearby drivers to request rides when they are unable to reach their destination through traditional means. Additionally, Alertify allows students to notify campus policies when necessary, promoting responsibility and safety within the college community.

## Features

1. **Connect with Drivers**: Students can use Alertify's web-based platform to connect with nearby drivers who are willing to provide rides. By leveraging the power of a community, students can quickly and easily find transportation options.

2. **Physical Button and Mobile Button**: Alertify provides students with both a physical button and a mobile button to request a ride. The physical button can be attached to backpacks or clothing for easy access, while the mobile button is available on the Alertify website.

3. **Notification System**: When a student presses the physical or mobile button, Alertify sends notifications to nearby drivers, alerting them of the ride request. This ensures that students receive prompt assistance when they need it.

4. **Campus Policy Notification**: In case of emergencies or violations of campus policies, Alertify allows students to notify the relevant campus authorities. This feature helps maintain safety and discipline within the college community.

## Prototype Webpage

As part of the Manage-A-Hack competition, our team developed a webpage to showcase Alertify's concept and features. The webpage provides an overview of the problem we aim to solve, the services we offer, and a demonstration of the physical and mobile buttons. It also highlights the importance of responsibility and safety within the college community.

## Conclusion

Alertify was developed as a solution to address transportation challenges faced by students in eastern North Carolina. Through the Manage-A-Hack competition, we were able to create a startup MVP, complete with a prototype and a business plan, within the given time frame. Our team believes that Alertify has the potential to make a positive impact on college campuses by promoting safety, responsibility, and community collaboration.
